3D Touch driven authentication training
===================


The following work has been done as part of a "Information Security vs Reality" course in Tel Aviv University.

The application is used as a proof of concept for using new mobile and desktop features to design Rubber Hose Secured authentication.
The 3D Touch technology introduced by Apple in their iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus is being studied as an additional dimension for implicit learning, the work is based on the following article:
[Neuroscience Meets Cryptography: Designing Crypto Primitives Secure Against Rubber Hose Attacks][1]



> **A Live example of the application:**

> - Should be used with iPhone 6S / iPhone 6S Plus for real evaluation.
> - On desktop & unsupported devices the force will be emulated by touch duration.
